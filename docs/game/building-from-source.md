# Building From Source
We try to make building from source as easy and intuitive as possible for developers of all skill levels. Care is being taken to avoid overly complicated or proprietary design project design choices, only using high-skill tools when they are absolutely nesseccary. As a result, building the client from source is almost as effortless as running one of the many Godot sample projects.

To build from source, make sure you have installed the [latest stable version 4.1 or higher](https://godotengine.org/download/) build of GodotEngine.

Next, download or git clone a copy of [the game client's repository](https://github.com/TailTwistStudios/Project-Calzone). (As of writing, the game is still undergoing heavy development; there are no "stable" class builds.)

Finally, simply open the project using the reccommended version.
