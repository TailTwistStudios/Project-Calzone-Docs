# Welcome to Project Calzone
Some important things to know about Project Calzone:

## Project Calzone is two-fold
The *whole* of Project Calzone exists as two separate project working in tandem:

- **Project Calzone Game** is a Godot 4 based game client. This is the game that Project Calzone users actually download and run.
- **Project Calzone Web** is an ExpressJS based REST API that handles the game client's login, session management, friends-lists, and federation needs.
