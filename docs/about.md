# A breif Introduction to the Fediverse
The Fediverse is a global network if independent social media platforms, that enable seemless interoperability accross multiple websites. Users of one website can communicate and coexist with eachother, even if one or the other are on completely different types of platforms. 

All of these website know how to communicate with eachother over well defined public standards. By using public standards, platforms completely different from each other can coexist, allowing users of both to communicate.

If all of this seems far-fetched, the global Email networks are *already* operating like this.
